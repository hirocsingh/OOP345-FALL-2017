    HOW TO FIX:
      Graphviz reads simple ascii file defining a graph and generates an image (picture) of that graph.

      It has been around for a while.  It is a mature open source package originally written by AT&T in the late 1990's.

      Graph layout is a mathematically complex problem.  Graphviz provides an elegant solution.

      You have likely used graphviz without knowing it.

      If you are using a utility that produces a diagram, such as E-R, UML, crows-foot, call graphs, etc, 
      there is a good chance the utility uses graphviz to generate the picture of the graph.

      It is everywhere.

      See http://www.webgraphviz.com to run graphviz live in a browser using javascript.

      Documentation, samples, binary versions for common operating systems, 
      or the source code can be downloaded from "http://graphviz.org".

    cmd += " -Tpng -O " + file; // -O flag - automatically generate the output file name with the proper suffix determined by -T image type flag 

    cout << "Running command -->" << cmd << "<--\n";
    int result = system(cmd.c_str());
    cout  << "It returned '" << result << (result?  "' (command failed)\n": "' (command passed)\n");
